## Project Repositories

To follow will be the repositories that be created and used for each project in the CMPG 323 module. The created repositories will store code, documentation, and other work related to each project. The repositories that will be created are CPMPG-323-Overview-25431285 - main branch, Project2 - feature, Project3 - feature, Project4 - feature, and Project5 - feature. Each Project will have its own submission date.

These repositories, can allow to manage, document and track any changes done to ensure all projects are completed, in preparation to the Portfolio of Evidence(POE).

#### .gitignore
.gitignore allows for ignoring or exclusing files and/or folders that I do not want to include in projects or repositories. This could be sensitive files that contain credentials. 

##### Credentials

#### Acess Control
This limits acess to my repository to choose collaborators, by setting both my repositories and projects to private and only sharing with the lecturers as collaborators.

#### Environment Variables
This allow for the storing of sensitive credentials as variables where the code is running, this will come into play when creating API.
